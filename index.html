            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I'm studying at Moringa School to gain the skills I need to become a software engineer. My goal is to learn how to solve problems using technology and build useful software.
            </p>
            <p>
                Iâ€™m passionate about technology because it helps people create and improve the world around them. Moringa School is helping me learn the skills I need to succeed in this field.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of my biggest inspirations is Formula 1. The hard work and determination of F1 drivers remind me of the persistence needed in software engineering. Just like in racing, I believe that dedication and constant improvement are key to success.

            <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
            <p>
                I love coding and enjoy creating new projects. I like to experiment with different programming languages and technologies to improve my skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                Reading novels is another hobby of mine. It helps me relax and also gives me fresh ideas and perspectives that I can apply in my work.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also enjoy going for walks, which helps clear my mind. Riding motorcycles is something I love, too, and I find it fun to tinker with machines and figure out how they work.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, I enjoy connecting with others in the tech community. I attend events and online meetups to learn and share ideas with fellow tech enthusiasts.
